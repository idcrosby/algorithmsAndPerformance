Implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming languages with the goal of comparing performance between different algorithms across languages.

TODO
=====

- Add analysis 'framework' which will run algorithms for various input sizes and depict performance as a relation to input.  
- graphical representation of sorting
- more languages (python, scala..)
-
